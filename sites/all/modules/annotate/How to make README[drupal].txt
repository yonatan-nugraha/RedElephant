README.txt file generally contains information
about who wrote the module and how to install it. Licensing information need not be included, as all
modules uploaded to drupal.org are GPL-licensed and the packaging script on drupal.org will
automatically add a LICENSE.txt file. Next, you could upload it to the contributions repository on
drupal.org, and create a project page to keep track of feedback from others in the community.
